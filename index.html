<h2 id="whatweredoing">What We're Doing</h2>

<p>The Infinity Flag is the original Burlington flag redesign. After finding the current Burlington flag online, we deciced Vermont's great queen city deserved more. We sent a letter to the Burlington City Council outlining the problems with our current flag and proposing the Inifnity Flag as the new official flag.</p>

<p>Together with the mayor, the city council has now elicited the help of the Burlington City Arts to help run a contest to find a new flag for the city. That contest has now begun, and we're lookign for your support!</p><p>Voting starts <strong>October, 20th</strong> and every vote counts.</p>

<p>Below you can read more about our design and the ways you can help support our flag.</p><h2 id="whatburlingtonhas">What Burlington Has</h2>

<p>Designed in the 90's by a Burlington 8th grader, the above flag has officially represented the great city of Burlington for almost 30 years. While the story may be quaint, I think we can all agree this flag does not reflect the quality of Vermont's queen city. If the city had a good flag, you would know about it.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://nava.org/digital-library/design/surveys/2004-American-City%20Flags-Survey.pdf">survey of flag enthusiasts</a>, Burlington’s current flag scored an average of 3.23 out of 10, ranking it 107th of 150 North American city flags.</p>

<ul>
<li>The white upper half is reminiscent of Vermont after a fresh snowfall: beautiful and peaceful.</li>

<li>The blue bottom half represents Burlington’s adjacent Lake Champlain, which is an important part of Burlington's history, economy, and recreation.</li>

<li>The symbol represents the city's infinite strive to improve, its ability to preserver, and its commitment to sustainability, being the first city in the country to <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/burlington-what-works-green-energy-214463">have achieved 100% reliance on renewable energy sources</a> .</li>

<li>The green humps of lemniscate symbolizes the green mountains.<ul><li>That half of the symbol also looks like Champ cresting over the lake’s surface!</li></ul>
</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="whatmakesagoodflag">What Makes a Good Flag</h2>

<p>The same organization that conducted the survey later released <a href="https://portlandflag.org/good-flag-bad-flag/"> a paper</a> that outlines 5 guiding principles to good flag design:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Keep It Simple</strong>: The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory</li>

<li><strong>Use Meaningful Symbolism</strong>: The flag’s images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes</li>

<li><strong>Use A Basic Color Pallet</strong>: Limit the pallet to two or three contrasting colors</li>

<li><strong>No Lettering or Seals</strong>: Never use writing of any kind or an organization’s seal</li>

<li><strong>Be Distinctive or Be Related</strong>: Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections</li>

</ol>

<p>Looking at the two flags side-by-side, it’s easy to see the ways the Infinity Flag uses these guidelines to achieve a professional aesthetic. These guidelines also help define the exact failures of the current flag.</p>

<p> The current flag has (1) a complex shield with 6 different symbols, which (2) vaugly relate to the city's values, (3) uses over 10 unique complex colors, and (4) is entirely lettering and a seal. (5) If you have to spell the name of the city on the flag, you've failed to make it unique or related.</p>

<p> The new flag (1) reduces the design to a single simple symbol, (2) pulls from city values to inspire the design, (3) uses 3 distinct basic colors, (4) lacks <em>any</em> lettering or seals, and (5) is one of the very few flags to use the infinity symbol.</p>

# btv-flag

In the winter of 2016, we sent a letter to the city council of Burlington, Vermont. In this letter, we expressed our disapproval of the little-known flag of the city. Designed in the 1980's by a middle school student, the current flag was an embarassment to Vermont's queen city.

This flag violates nearly every rule of vexillography, the study of flag design. The current flag was nowhere to be seen in Vermont's largest and most vibrant city. In a 2004 survey of vexillologists, Vermont's city flags did not fare well. Montpeliers flag (which would soon become a part of this project) was ranked 9th _worst_ in the country, with a score of 2.35 our of 10, a grade of D-minus. Montpelier was beaten out only slightly by Burlington, which was ranked 107th out of the 150  with a 3.23 out of 10, a D grade.

A proper city flag should both reflect her values and give the citizen's an outlet to associate with those values. No citizen would wear that flag on a t-shirt or wish to see it fly above city hall. A new design was clearly needed.

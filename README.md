## What We're Doing

The Infinity Flag is the original Burlington flag redesign. After finding the current Burlington flag online, we deciced Vermont's great queen city deserved more. We sent a letter to the Burlington City Council outlining the problems with our current flag and proposing the Inifnity Flag as the new official flag.

Together with the mayor, the city council has now elicited the help of the Burlington City Arts to help run a contest to find a new flag for the city. That contest has now begun, and we're lookign for your support!

Voting starts October, 20th and every vote counts.

Below you can read more about our design and the ways you can help support our flag.

## What Burlington Has

Designed in the 90's by a Burlington 8th grader, the above flag has officially represented the great city of Burlington for almost 30 years. While the story may be quaint, I think we can all agree this flag does not reflect the quality of Vermont's queen city. If the city had a good flag, you would know about it.

In a survey of flag enthusiasts, Burlington’s current flag scored an average of 3.23 out of 10, ranking it 107th of 150 North American city flags.

## What Burlington Deserve

![infinity flag](flag/btv_infinity.png)

* The white upper half is reminiscent of Vermont after a fresh snowfall: beautiful and peaceful.
* The blue bottom half represents Burlington’s adjacent Lake Champlain, which is an important part of Burlington's history, economy, and recreation.
* The symbol represents the city's infinite strive to improve, its ability to preserver, and its commitment to sustainability, being the first city in the country to have achieved 100% reliance on renewable energy sources .
* The green humps of lemniscate symbolizes the green mountains.
* That half of the symbol also looks like Champ cresting over the lake’s surface!

## What Makes a Good Flag

The same organization that conducted the survey later released a paper that outlines 5 guiding principles to good flag design:

* Keep It Simple: The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory
* Use Meaningful Symbolism: The flag’s images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes
* Use A Basic Color Pallet: Limit the pallet to two or three contrasting colors
* No Lettering or Seals: Never use writing of any kind or an organization’s seal
* Be Distinctive or Be Related: Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections

Looking at the two flags side-by-side, it’s easy to see the ways the Infinity Flag uses these guidelines to achieve a professional aesthetic. These guidelines also help define the exact failures of the current flag.

The current flag has (1) a complex shield with 6 different symbols, which (2) vaugly relate to the city's values, (3) uses over 10 unique complex colors, and (4) is entirely lettering and a seal. (5) If you have to spell the name of the city on the flag, you've failed to make it unique or related.

The new flag (1) reduces the design to a single simple symbol, (2) pulls from city values to inspire the design, (3) uses 3 distinct basic colors, (4) lacks any lettering or seals, and (5) is one of the very few flags to use the infinity symbol.
What We Can Do

Thanks to our letter to the city coucil, Burlington City Arts is working with the city to select a new flag! Here's the timeline for the selction process from The BCA page:

1. Submissions accepted online: September 1
2. Deadline for all submissions: October 15
3. Finalists selected and public voting: October 20-November 17
4. Winning design chosen and announced: November 20
5. Flag unveiling: December 31 during First Night

We hope you vote for the Infinity Flag!

# Update

## What Burlington Got

The Infinity flag was disqualified from the election. The contest was restricted to residents of Burlington. While I don't neccesarily agree with this restriction, I can understand it. Vermont's queen city deserves a flag it can be proud of.

I am very happy with the winning flag! The new flag was designed by native Burlingtonians Owen and Lucas Marchessault. The new flag flew for the first time on December 31, 2017.

Mayor Miro Weinberger had this to say:

> Congratulations to Owen and Lucas Marchessault on the selection of their design, which beautifully conveys our city’s history, character, and natural environment, as the new City of Burlington flag. It is fitting that a design created by two Burlington students should be chosen to replace the City’s original student-designed flag.

The new flag definitely follows the guidelines I used to design my flag:

* The sky, representing looking back to our rich history and ahead to the unknown future with perpetual hope
* Snow covered mountains - an indelible backdrop to our city
* The Green Mountain State, Burlington’s commitment to the environment, and education
* The breakwater, which protects Burlington’s spectacular waterfront, and
* Lake Champlain, which sustains and enriches our community and lives.
